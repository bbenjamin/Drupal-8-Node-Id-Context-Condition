# Node ID context for Drupal 8
This module adds the ability to create context conditions based on Node ID. 

Once enabled "Node Id" will be added to the list of conditions available to a context. You can add multiple node IDs
to the condition.

Note that the context is only triggered on the public theme - it is ignored on admin themes.
